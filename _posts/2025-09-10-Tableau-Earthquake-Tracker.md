## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Earthquake Tracking Dashboard** built using Tableau. It visualizes global seismic activity over a 30-day period, enabling users to explore patterns, magnitudes, and regional distributions of earthquakes.

The dashboard is designed to provide quick insights into earthquake frequency, intensity, and geographic trends through an intuitive and visually engaging interface.

---

## Key Features
- **Global Map Visualization**  
  Interactive map displaying earthquake occurrences with color-coded magnitude intensity.

- **Top 10 Earthquakes**  
  Highlights the most significant earthquakes based on magnitude and location.

- **Regional Distribution Analysis**  
  Percentage breakdown of earthquakes by continent/region.

- **Magnitude Insights**  
  Comparative view of:
  - Average Magnitude  
  - Maximum Magnitude  
  across different locations.

- **Date Filtering**  
  Dynamic filtering to analyze earthquake activity over specific time ranges.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** – Dashboard design and data visualization  
- **Geospatial Data** – Mapping earthquake coordinates  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Structured raw seismic data for analysis  

---

## Insights & Outcomes
- Identified high-frequency earthquake zones such as the Pacific Ring of Fire.
- Observed that **North America and Central America** account for a significant share of recorded activity.
- Enabled quick detection of regions with unusually high magnitude spikes.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of real-time earthquake data (API-based)
- Alert system for high-magnitude earthquakes
- Predictive analytics using historical seismic trends

---

## Summary
This project demonstrates my ability to design **data-driven, interactive dashboards** that transform raw data into meaningful insights, with a strong focus on usability and storytelling.
